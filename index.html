    <p>The painting has been definitively identified to depict Italian noblewoman Lisa Gherardini,[9] the wife of
        Francesco del Giocondo. It is painted in oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel. Leonardo never gave the painting
        to the Giocondo family, and later it is believed he left it in his will to his favored apprentice Sala√¨.[10] It
        had been believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506; however, Leonardo may have continued working on it
        as late as 1517. It was acquired by King Francis I of France and is now the property of the French Republic. It
        has been on permanent display at the Louvre in Paris since 1797.[11]
